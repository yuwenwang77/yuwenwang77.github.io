Welcome to my academic profile! I am Yuwen Wang, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on nano-biomaterials and functional hydrogels for musculoskeletal disease treatment. Currently, I develop nature-inspired nanoparticles for bone regeneration and pioneer fabrication technologies for organ-on-a-chip platforms.

I hold a B.Sc. in Applied Chemistry from Shandong University (2020) and an M.Res. in Nanomaterials from Imperial College London (2021). My research interest includes: Smart nanoparticles, Functional hydrogel systems, and Advanced platforms for: Musculoskeletal regeneration and Anti-aging therapeutics. I have published several papers at the top journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kYMYxr4AAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>100+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kYMYxr4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

- The review emphasizes the enhanced load-bearing capacity, bioactivity, and tissue integration that can be achieved through hierarchical designs. Notwithstanding the potential of these applications, significant barriers to progress persist, including challenges related to long-term biocompatibility, regulatory hurdles, and scalable manufacturing. Finally, we propose future directions, including machine learning-guided design and patient-specific biomanufacturing to accelerate clinical translation. Multiscale metal-based nanocomposites, which bridge nanoscale innovations with macroscale functionality, are a revolutionary force in the field of biomedical engineering, providing personalized regenerative solutions for bone and joint diseases.
