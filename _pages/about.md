Welcome to my academic profile! I am Yuwen Wang, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on nano-biomaterials and functional hydrogels for musculoskeletal disease treatment. Currently, I develop nature-inspired nanoparticles for bone regeneration and pioneer fabrication technologies for organ-on-a-chip platforms.

I hold a B.Sc. in Applied Chemistry from Shandong University (2020) and an M.Res. in Nanomaterials from Imperial College London (2021). My research interest includes: Smart nanoparticles, Functional hydrogel systems, and Advanced platforms for: Musculoskeletal regeneration and Anti-aging therapeutics. I have published several papers at the top journals with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kYMYxr4AAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>100+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kYMYxr4AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

- In this review, we first summarize the chiral nano-/microstructures that can be used for regenerative medicine applications, including chiral nanomaterials, chiral supramolecular hydrogels, and chiral topography. Computational and simulation methods that can be used to study chiral structures are systematically summarized. In addition, the mechanisms by which chiral engineered biomaterials affect cellular responses will be comprehensively reviewed in terms of cell adhesion receptors, intracellular signaling pathways, and regulation of gene expression profiles. Specific examples will be used to illustrate the ability of chiral biomaterials to direct cell fate decisions, such as inducing stem cell differentiation along specific lineages or regulating macrophages to different phenotypes.
